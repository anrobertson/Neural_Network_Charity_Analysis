# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The objective of this project is to employ deep-learning neural networks utilizing the TensorFlow platform in Python to evaluate and categorize the efficacy of charitable contributions. The analysis incorporates the following approaches:
* Preparing the data for the neural network model through preprocessing.
* Undertaking the tasks of compiling, training, and evaluating the model.
* Engaging in the process of optimizing the model in a professional manner.
